# Capture Library

Local capture inputs that drive video performance and timing.

Suggested layout:
- phonemes/ : short clips with clear syllables/visemes (single speaker).
- poses/    : full-body or upper-body pose clips.
- notes/    : capture notes, lighting setups, or camera specs.

Naming (example):
- phonemes/phoneme_v1_ka_01.mp4
- poses/pose_v1_032_fullbody.mp4

Keep clips short, stable, and consistent in lighting.
