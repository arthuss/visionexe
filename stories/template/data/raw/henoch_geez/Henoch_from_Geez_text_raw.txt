The Sacred Words which Henoch [received] 
ቃለ፡Åረ…ት፡ዘሄኖŒ። 
The Book of the prophecy of Divine Love at work in the Earth 
during the last days. 
መትጽሐፉ፡ሄኖŒ፡ ነቢይ። - Book of the Prophet Henoch  
The Book of Great Joy and Wisdom, reviewing the incalculable 
value of Humankind to our Heavenly Father. 
 This text is a translation, from a conflation of verses preserved  
in the Ge'ez language by the Ethiopian peoples, which Yahweh put 
into their hearts to keep this book for us in these last days. For this 
conflation, we compare the text within the manuscripts from The 
Remnant inc., The Ethiopian Manuscript Microfilm Library EMML 
2080, the Hill Museum & Manuscript Library GG-151, and 
Bodleian Library Oxford Library MS Bruce/MS Bodley. That makes 
a total of four Ge'ez sources utilized in this translation. Additionally, 
we use the Rylands Ethiopic MS 23 for comparison in certain places 
when it is needed, and the introduction comes from the Schøyen 
Collection MS 2657.  
 All contained here is our translation from original Ge'ez 
manuscripts.

Abraham reads the book of Henoch 
At the time when Abram and Sarai were in Egypt in the house of Pharaoh: 
… on account of my words, and of my wife, they gave to me many presents 
expecting from me goodness wisdom and truth. I read to them the book of the 
words of Henoch …  1

About this translation  
The Ge'ez text, in this document, comes from these manuscripts labeled:
B = MS Bruce 74, and MS Bodley 531 from the Bodleian Library at Oxford England 
E = EMML 2080 Hill Museum Manuscript Library 
G = GG 00151 Hill Museum Manuscript Library
R = Remnant Trust Collection
S = Schøyen Collection, MS 2657
RE = Rylands Ethiopic MS 23
Rubiﬁed words are mirrored from MSS [manuscripts] examples and are used herein from our 
desire to point out certain verses.
Lavender-colored words are meant to point out poetic verse used in the Ge’ez language to be 
read, considered, and then determine the poetic value of the words. Ge’ez communicates by 
using similitudes. 
Uppercase letters denote deity as He, His, and My. Depending on context allows us to think 
of a singular unit of the Ehmelek’t or the dual-ness of Ehmelek’t.
Notes 
 Words or phrases enclosed in double brackets [ ] have been added fo r 
clarity by the editor and are not a part of the original Ge'ez text. These brackets 
are used to name the pronouns used profusely in the Ge'ez text. 
 While reading The Book of Henoch, it is essential to keep in min d: ‘The 
Book of Henoch’ uses the words: sinners, godless, ungodly, godlessness, 
wicked, and evil spirits. These terms only apply to the fallen Angels and their 
kind. Only Humankind is justified to live on Earth, and no other kind was 
selected to be here. The term Humankind is hyphenated throughout this 
document to distinguish Humankind from spirit-kind. Humankind is a term 
that includes all genders of the species called human. Spirit-kind denotes the 
offspring of the fallen Angels, and Humankind denotes Adam’s offspring, the 
offspring of the Lord-of-Spirits. 
 This book is translated from the Ge'ez manuscripts preserved by the 
Ethiopians. I have wholeheartedly approached the text of the Book of Henoch 
as divinely inspired text inscribed by Henoch. The Ge'ez words in these 
manuscripts were not translated from any other language. Henoch copied this 
book, then gave that copy to Noah, who then gave it to Abraham, who read it to 
the Egyptians when he and Sara went to encamp there. I believe that Ge'ez is 
the language spoken by Henoch, Noah, and Abraham. Then the Ge'ez words 
transitioned into Hebrew and Arabic from Abraham’s influence on his 
12

=== Page 15 ===
children’s language. There are remarkable resemblances between these 
languages resulting into the Hebrew and Arabic languages that use many Ge'ez 
root words. This fact presents itself in the dictionaries I use. 
 Ge'ez language lexicons and the understanding of its prose and gram mar 
have improved from the 1800s. Scientific knowledge has also increased, which 
helps understand the many verses containing such knowledge—and this was 
my advantage in 2013 when I began this project. I have attempted to make it 
easier for the reader to understand using modern English and descriptive 
phrases instead of pronouns (Ge'ez is replete with pronouns).  
 Henoch wrote directly to us, his decedents, and what he wrote was 
reiterated throughout the canonized scriptures by a wide variety of people: The 
Patriarchs, the Prophets, King David, Yeshuah, and his Disciples, all reminding 
us of what they read, which was preserved for us in this book.   
 I believe that The Book of Henoch, revived and revisited, fulfill s the 
prophecy of Yeshuah at Mat 24:14 KJV “And this gospel of the kingdom shall 
be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the 
end come.” 
 We were compelled to do this translation by the unction of th e Holy Spirit, 
who made us aware of so many versions of this precious book with deletions, 
insertions, and rearrangements. All Ge’ez words from the manuscripts are 
translated from Ge’ez to English in the order they appear; none of the Ge’ez 
text has been excluded or deemed unnecessary to make the point. The 
advantages we have in translating this book today are the many tools we have: 
the use of a computer for word processing, Stellarium Astronomy software to 
view the stars, and we have all the descriptions of natural items using the 
internet. 
 The original Ge'ez text in this book was given to Henoch from o ur Heavenly 
Father so that Humankind would fully know what to expect in the last days.

       In this way, He blesses us; by choosing 
to make them righteous, from they who were 
to exist [from the list], being accounted for 
that day they are made holy in that 
region of 
spirits [the Milky Way, Asafa’el]. This happens 
because of the expulsion of those held 
therein, being these corrupt ones to be 
forgotten.

 When Henoch is speaking as a man 
henceforth, he speaks the truth about being 
in the presence of the one who possesses all 
things. Whereas what he sees with his eyes, 
consider sacred, for this is his function. The 
things he receives in visions are also from 
Angels.

 For I will be witnessed when coming 
near to them all [when at Rest], when this 
book is made known at that distant time I 
reveal it, by no means not through the books 
legitimized, but instead, after that distant 
time for the sake of those He has selected to 
reveal it to, and to reveal that those will 
emerge to perform holy offices, all of them 
listed as resurrected to abide with to be in the 
presence with He who will tread upon Mount 
Sinai, and His host appears to conceal them 
who do not have the strength to defend 
themselves against this host from Heaven [the 
Milky Way, Asafa’el].

 Now, they will be afraid of this

 When they are seized, it will be made 
apparent when there is a powerful quake 
within the confines of the Earth—when they 
are terror-struck unto its far-off regions. 
They will be like a honeycomb in front of a 
blaze when they pour into the bottom of this 
pit for imprisonment inside the Earth, for in 
this way, they will be void.

 After this sentence of the Most-High is 
passed, all of them justified [to be here] rise. 
All those justified are greeted in peace
 w h e n  
He is being careful to handle them with care, 
being those He recognizes [from the list] and 
those who are forgiven. When they are all 
raised, they become established to have 
possession. He labors to make those a 
blessing, when they light up in their 
brightness in possession of their estate, after 
a myriad of His sanctified host, likened unto 
Him, work to pass this sentence, made up of 
them from on high, to void those that 
neglected their estate.

 He will disapprove and hold back all of 
the flesh in her set to be resurrected until 
these godless cannot be found. Nor will these 
[evil] be able to behold, not at all, the 
workmanship inside Heaven, how when they 
are transformed as date palms [as a good 
work, unmovable], to be bright as they which 
are already inside Heaven [the Milky Way, 
Asafa’el], by the way, these are set in their 
order every seventh, shining as any Heavenly 
body established and held within, this entire 
time. An estate belonging to them who now 
will not transgress from the assignments 
given to them, to be seen by you of the Earth. 
Now have understanding of this work, He will 
perform, as it is written.

 When the war rages and they see 
even their cherished ones being destroyed 
by them from above, they [the fallen 
Angels] will wail and beg for them to exist 
an eternity and for Him to greet them with 
compassion.

 Henoch departed from Azaza’el, 
saying, “They will not have peace, and 
they will not prevail over those emerging 
from on high to secure them for passing 
this sentence.”

 These petitioned to have tolerance—
this will not happen, for these teaching by 
vexation [chattering], to do all works of 
blasphemy and sins of wrongful doing 
which Humankind received by their 
shepherding, for them to follow the way of 
life which they had rehearsed to all of 
them, at the same time. These become 
fearful with dread when seizing those who 
had petitioned to Him in a document, 
begging that He will judge them forgiven 
and ascend back into the presence of He 
who is in Heaven.

 However, their function will no 
longer be to encircle in their presence 
there, and they will not speak towards nor 
raise their faces to Heaven, disgraced from 
having this dominion.

 Also thereafter, disgraced from what 
was written in the notation petitioning for 
what would benefit them, and what could 
be done for those spirits who had changed 
their minds [concerning their union].

 After this, sleep came upon me, and I 
saw in a vision concerning those He casts 
out. And in this vision, I saw what happened 
after making a summons to those sons of 
Heaven, attentive themselves for this 
conviction to happen at that distant time. 
When they were all assembled and seated for 
mourning beside the water of Ubles’yael, this 
place between Senir [Seneser] and Lebanon, 
they commenced with veils over their faces as 
I spoke with them. Seeing all I saw on 
account of this slumber, gaining information 
concerning this voice calling for them to be 
aligned with Him to seize these fallen Angels 
of Heaven. 
This book was written—for those 
innocent of this rebuke towards those, I saw 
in this dream, rebuking them so that He can 
call
 for those to be raised and made holy.

 Because of this, I saw in my slumber 
[knowledge] for that distant time. My 
slumber, for now, was used to inform me 
using the language established for 
Humankind [Ge’ez], and I was blessed with a 
thunderous voice, compared to other men, 
allowing me to speak unto those [fallen 
Angels] who are wailing.

RE On account, that it is the renown of the Most-
High to show mercy and compassion, at the 
time of calamity, with abundant compassion 
speaking the truth in this adorned book; 
I 
Henoch, a prophet, was blessed to deliver this 
book as an available helper, so [the Rest 
period] is working to bring forth this [resting 
time] early to what He desires for Humankind 
forever. Amen
 Henoch 39:2 Now, regarding that day, Henoch’s writings are accepted as a healing balm for a vast 
number now zealous for his library of books; this acceptance causes an uproar because of the number 
of mercies that will come to pass for those raised at the command of the Lord-of-Spirits.

were harming, and became godless, are

G 1:2 Now harken to what is being said, 
“Henoch is a man who speaks the truth of 
what is near to the Most-High. Whereas, He 
will receive eyes open to see holy visions by 
revealing that which is in the Heavens. Which 
likewise, all the Angels testified from being in 
His presence.” “What is shown to him is for a

is not for this generation but benefiting the

Seeing how a third of countless is a very large number so I looked into the number 200 being translated 
into words that can be used here. ፪፻ can be translated either as the number ‘two-hundred’ or ‘restrained 
by wrath’. I used this parsing of the manuscript numbers, ፪፻, because two-hundred is not a third of the 
Angels. [Rev 12:4 KJV] 4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of Heaven, and did cast them to 
the Earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her

G 8:1 Now, Azaza’el taught Humankind how to 
conduct themselves with swords and how to 
dwell with the slaughterings. Then, he 
showed them breast protection, with a 
breastplate and a leather cuirass behind 
them. Then, he showed them how to make 
bracelets for adornment, paint eyelids with 
Antimony, and beautify eyelashes. He showed 
them how to select all stones to be used

cast there into that place.”
በዱድኤል - Duda’el - Neither Ge'ez nor Hebrew lexicons identify this term, indicating this is a proper 
name; nevertheless, my best estimation is that this word means “through (by) a (my) strong voice,” see 
ድድ - voice, sound, and ኤል - el (Hebrew for -the strength of). This estimation is from the fact that 
something extremely powerful is needed to bind an angel the magnitude of Azaza’el. Using His voice is 
similar to the way Arsyalalyur had the authority to use His Name when speaking to Noah.

B 13:1 Wherefore, Henoch stepped aside and 
spoke to Azaza’el, “Peace will not happen; the 
one promoted to pass sentence upon they 
who departed from the heights is this same 
one established to pass sentence upon you.”
Isaiah talks about Azaza’el as a bright star. [Isa 14:13 KJV] 13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will 
ascend into Heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the 
congregation, in the sides of the north: At the Day of Covering [Yom Kippur] the scapegoat represents 
Azaza’el who is sent to a desolate area. [Lev 16:8 KJV] 8 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; 
one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat [Azaza’el (צזאזל]. Note that this day of 
covering is a day of remembering that the source of evil will be covered within the caldera, by the Lord-
of-Spirits.

turned to observe seven glorious regions 
visible there. With each, one after the other, 
beginning at the first one, and each is 
different, yet each is made of stones of glory 
so they can be seen. Each is there for Good, 
and each is glorious in its praise when they 
are visible. Their appearance is correct, with 
three where the light grows to fulfill the first 
on account of each, then three by the side, of 
the south which then the mighty [fallen

of those wicked ones, who are to be 
submerged in that deep place, are they who 
distorted the first one, regarding this first one 
which they did not present [to Humankind].

those who are from among them a tree [an

and not one which is from among those 
separated by how they have not become 
fragrant in the presence of all, as a tree that 
eventually emits a pleasing odor, at the time

This tree will never be dim, to the advantage

saw yonder himself [Zuta’el] towards those 
trees big enough to form the frames of a 
house, numerous and prevailing there where 
they are growing in that place. Then, while 
their pleasant odor is fittingly powerful, they 
are numerous unto the border, and they 
honor the Tree of wisdom from which together 
they [Adam and Hha'vah [Eve]] by means [of 
this tree] took part in his [example] which 
was repeated twice because of his prevailing 
subtleness.
Superfecundation [when two separate fathers have fertilized two eggs in a woman’s womb] is apparent 
here, the father of Cain [the black-haired calf] was Na’hash [the serpent נחש], and the father of Abel [the 
red-haired calf] being Adam. See Genesis 3:1-6, Gen 4:1 [Scriptures Version] When Adam was intimate 
from living with Ha’vah [Eve], what was desired for a woman, to bring forth a child, saying, this same 
Cain I have obtained from living with the Lord [one of strength]. Eve seems to be saying, Abel, I received 
from Adam, and Cain I received from the Lord [Eve thinking that Na’hash was the Lord, apparently, he 
told her he was. See also Hen 69:7 Then because of how these departed their place above to be those 
who dwelt upon the Earth where she was present at that time, and they are responsible for this crime 
towards Humankind an eternity.

E 32:6 A holy angel now in my company 
responded to me, saying, “This same such 
tree [angel] of wisdom was consumed 
[entering their body] by they who are your 
aged father and mother; who were shown this 
in the beginning [by Nahash the serpent]. 
Thus setting this wisdom free unto their

how they were naked and why they were 
exiled from the Garden of Eden.”
Na'hash [the serpent נחש], [Gen 3:1-3 KJV] 1 Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the 
field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat 
of every tree of the garden? 2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees 
of the garden: 3 But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall 
not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

emerge from these divisions. I wrote 
everything down which arose, the when and

their count and the names assigned to them 
and their place of residence for they of them 
in the period of their month. In this way, the

while one of them comes forth as winds in

where it blows cold with snow, ice, frost, and 
wetness which then becomes rainfall.
Henoch talks about the north pole and the Earth’s rotation around the pole, and its role in the Earth’s 
weather system. British Admiral William Edward Perry explored the pole in 1827, but Henoch and

ordained in addition to those places ordained 
for them when they [Humankind] will beseech 
[the Lord], and their supplication will be 
made suitable through these upright Angels 
for the sake of the children of Humankind. 
These [Angels] are aligned to these 
supplications by how water flows from them 
in their presence when these become 
compassionate and moisten the land by how 
it is done, through these [clouds] in their 
midst, for Humankind at that time.

and be trustworthy to speak the truth. It was

however, none of them were in front of them

G 41:8 Since the Sun’s light is more significant, 
having dominion over the lights within these 
blessed objects, it is an abhorrence to regard 
the journey of the Moon’s course as 
righteous, desiring this lesser light. The Lord 
created the light and the darkness this way. 
He was the one who assigned them a spirit for 
the advantage of Humankind, when they 
remain in their place regarding being 
faithfully aligned to how He placed them.
For all things, the Sun has year around benefits coming from its heat and light. See Hen 4:1, and 41:6 
Additionally, the Sun is used for noting the beginning of each month. A particular star has been 
appointed to align with the Sun's rising at the beginning of each month. See Hen 75:3, 82:15 Through 
the inspiration of the Most-High, Henoch reminds us that evil could take advantage of this, thus 
disturbing the counting of months, thus affecting resting days; nevertheless, this does not happen 
because of the way the star's positioning is established as immovable. Henoch also reminds us of the 
places reserved for the resurrected innocent ones, from abortions and miscarriages [the innocent 
unborn], who become bright stars and will replace the positions of all those who left their first estate.

brightness when they were receiving

to those truths spoken in the name of the 
Lord everlasting.

saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, 
saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.

E 58:5 Because their talking is meaningless 
regarding those declared holy by Heaven after 
this. This separation is because they [evil] 
pursued the list of those justified [to be here]. 
By having faith in these words, they 
[Humankind] will be just as the stars that

Earth’s  surface  that  their  [evil’s]

R 60:1 Continuing through these things 
occurring in my lifetime up to my, five 
hundredth year.  Then in the seventh month 
of that year, and the fourth day after resting, 
is when I Henoch saw how He appears 
glittering in Heaven and calls unto those who 
have been glittering in Heaven promoting 
them with the ability to be superior along 
with this commander of ten-thousand by ten-
thousand fold, who prevail by stirring up an 
agitation.
Methuselah and Lemek were alive, then at the time when people could not find him, because Henoch 
was taken to live with the Angels. Henoch was 365 years old when he was hidden by these Angels. 
Henoch was returned to live with Humankind, and after which Lamech seeks out Henoch, to talk to 
him about Noah’s white appearance when he was born, and lived on to be more than five-hundred 
years old. see Henoch 60:1 for this age, and notice Noah speaks to Henoch right at the time of the flood. 
see also Hen 81:8, see also [Gen 5:24 KJV] 24 And Enoch walked with God: and he [was] not; for God 
took him. See also the Calendar month seven day ten, this is the day for remembering the covering of 
Azaza’el [Yom Kippur].

The word, quarter, is used for a seasonal division.
The word, division, is used for the point along the horizon , were the Sun rises, also any type of division.
The word, doorway, is used for a location where light or wind is transmitted, also a modem for communication.
The word, window, is used for where rain drops from the sky, where wind blows through them, and Heav enly lights 
shine through them, also a modem for communication.
The word, portal, is used for any opening allowing light or wind to pass through, a modem for communication.
The word, star, is used to indicate a spirit in Heaven, and is also in reference to an ange l. What Henoch described 
as trees planted in the Milky Way, Asafa’el, were stars.
A new day starts at morning Sunrise.
A Rest begins at twilight, and ends at Sunrise the next morning.
The word luminary is used to indicate all the objects in Heaven that either reﬂect or emit light.
The day gifted to the head of a season, this is the day gifted and joined to each season.

R 72:1 This book answers how and why the 
lights in Heaven  are present to exclaim to all 
people so the people can jubilate and Rest, 
having happiness [peace] at this time. With 
all of the stars in their time to exclaim, these, 
He has named himself, from their nativity, 
when they exclaim themselves each month. 
This information comes from the holy angel 
Uriel in my company showing me where they 
[doorways] open and where the stars are 
retained. By showing how a year is made 
harmonious to Humankind. These will 
produce the product to renew [the Milky Way, 
Asafa’el] along with those remaining to the 
advantage of Humankind.

doorways as the Sun’s light emerges, 
compared to the length of time for six Moon 
risings at that place where the doorways 
open, and regarding the risings of the stars in 
the places where the six doorways open.

with the numerous doorways for opening on

Henoch introduces these terms for establishing times of the day when no cl ocks existed. These were only 
general times, not meant to be precise.
• Hour - For daytime, an hour is the twelfth part of the duration from Sunrise to Sunset . For nighttime, 
an hour is the twelfth part of the duration from Sunset to Sunrise. This ‘hour’ is  not necessarily sixty 
minutes; these durations change throughout the year because of the seasons. The ter m hour is more 
like what we would call a twelfth.
• Watch - The duration of the night, from Sunset to Sunrise, is ﬁrst halved, and then those c an be halved 
into quarters resulting in a ﬁrst, second, third, and fourth watch.

However, when the Moon is full, rising in its 
brightest phase, this only happens at night

when it starts to become evening in the

B 73:8 Now, to begin the year on Rest day, it is 
accomplished when the year has ended by the 
Sun in the east, through the day to be 
abandoned, even though it is the seventh 
evening of seven evenings.
Technically, the Sun and Moon are in the sky visible together at some time of every day except at the 
moment of the Full Moon. Here is a rough breakdown: At the New Moon: Moon rises and sets with the 
Sun. Moon is up every minute that the Sun is up, but you can't see the New Moon. At the Waxing 
crescent: Moon rises shortly after the Sun, and both are up until Sunset, yet the Moon is difficult to 
see. In the First quarter: Moon rises at Noon, and they are both up until Sunset. At the Waxing gibbous: 
Moon rises sometime between Noon and Sunset, and both are up from Moonrise until Sunset. At the 
Full Moon: Moon rises at Sunset, technically, never up simultaneously. At the Waning gibbous: Moon 
rises after Sunset. Still up for a while after Sunrise. In the Third quarter: Moon rises at Midnight and is 
in the sky from Sunrise until mid-day. At the Waning crescent: Moon rises shortly before the Sun and 
sets shortly before the Sun. Very difficult to see. - credit answers.com

A year should be 364 days, adding the day of waiting, ‘the extension beyond that thirtieth day’, to the 
total adds an additional 1.2422 days, so 5 years X 1.2422 days = 6.211 extra days. The Gregorian 
calendar does this by counting 365.2422 days in a year, then uses leap time [years/months/days] for 
the overage in time.

Then, summing at the fifth year, it will be 
short [from the Sun’s count] by fifty days, and 
the month’s day count would already have 
been deficient, by a day, by the reckoning of 
the Moon’s sixty-second rising.
A lunar year is 354 days, and 3 years X 354 days =1,062 days, and 5 years X 354 days =1,770. A solar 
year is 364 days, 5 years X 364 days =1820 and five lunar years subtracted from five solar years 
1820-1770=50 day difference. Also: Each lunar month is roughly 29.5 solar days. This says that in 
thirty rotations it is .5 days behind the solar days, then a further thirty rotations again .5 = one day 
behind, at sixty rotations and even more behind at sixty-two rotations.

point on the horizon, where the Sun rises on that same day. This aligned point of rising does not 
happen on days other than March 17. Also: The wheeling of the Sun and planets in Heaven, occurs as

this is how those are to be accounted.

Instead of saying ‘cold’, the phrase ’deprived of heat’ was used. Ge’ez is the powerful and poetic

R 78:15 The Moon observes her ordinances, 
then there is a three day period [of fertility] to 
know the result at the next cycle that was 
hers. At that time, she will wane from what 
was hers when it is in production by the third 
Moon. These are produced by how the Moon 
affects them [females] on account of what 
happens  during  these  twenty-nine  
brightnesses [of a Moon’s cycle lasting twenty 
eight days] which were present therein which 
caused the waning that was hers concerning 
this [three day] period in the beginning. 
Because at a particular hour, the period will 
continue to the one-hundred and seventy-
seventh brightness, in addition to the next 
cycle.
A gestation cycle is 280 days. One Moon cycle of 29.5 cycles takes 28 days to accomplish. This verse 
describes 3 cycles at first, then six cycles by its descriptor 177 brightnesses so at 29.5 rotations per 
cycle this= 6 cycles. Then 3 cycles + 6 cycles = 9 cycles X 28 per 29.5 [yes the text is translated 29 days, 
but when describing numbers in Ge’ez, numbers are usually rounded to the nearest decimal point] 
rotations which then = 252 days. Then 252 days plus 28 days for the last cycle = 280 days which is the 
requirement for human gestation.

the sixth week’s

This assignment is a portion of those that the

Doctors, know that ovum in the ovaries start to mature again about six weeks after giving birth, the

The Lord-of-Spirits has placed the spirits of all the innocent unborn inside a chamber waiting for the 
moment the Lord-of-Spirits has victory over evil by casting them into the caldera, then these unborn 
spirits are raised to replace the open places in the Milky Way, Azaza’el, vacated when the fallen Angels 
left this estate. See 68:4 Then it will come to pass for them [innocent unborn] to stand in His presence, 
as the Lord-of-Spirits intended it to be. Michael said this concerning Rufael, “It will not come to pass to 
them [fallen Angels] to continue remaining as a watcher for the Lord. This Lord-of-Spirits will punish

The word Hyena describes this period leading to the everlasting kingdom. This

the next age. This time represents the period when all power of Heaven and 
Earth are summoned to appear along with Him [the Lord-of-Spirits] to remove 
all evil from the Earth’s surface. So when evil has been safely cast away, all the 
spirits destined for Asafa’el are elevated to their place of planting. Then all 
spirits of Humankind are resurrected to the Earth’s surface to live everlasting 
as a dual with the Ehmelek’t [Possessors, as a dual] in peace.

R 106:5 Then the midwife grasped with her 
hand inside to loosen the brim [by perineal 
massage], and as she kneeled, the blessing of 
the Lord came true. [The child was] feared by 
his father Lamech, and he ran to ask his 
father because he did not have faith how [this 
happened] from his time [with his wife]. 
However, he [the child] resembled the Angels 
of Heaven, and now I am here, close to you 
[Henoch], so you can tell me what is true.
In Ge'ez, the term father or even mother can be a reference to grandparents. In this case, Lamech uses 
the term father when referring to his grandfather Henoch.

Lamech was the last of our fathers to see the Stars as they were first created, and feared that his son 
Noah came from one of the Angels that descended after seeing the daughters of Humankind. see

R 106:7 These [stars] are to be named because 
that distant generation does not have them in 
their wholeness. Not whole from being 
disobedient towards righteousness when they 
stepped aside from indicating these

when seeing them there. These will be named 
so that distant generations can observe the

those stepped aside from their assignments to

are the same for the northern and 
souther n hemispheres; only the 
agricultural seasons progress starting 
from Fall (S) [like Spring (N)], Winter (S) 
[like Summer (N)], Spring (S) [like Fall (N)], 
then Summer (S) [like Winter (N)]. These 
stars were planted in these places from 
the beginning and were not expected to 
move. The stars we see today have 
remained holy to what was expected of 
them to do.
The day begins at daybreak 
In this verse we read that a day starts at 
daybreak, 72:8 When the Sun rises in 
Heaven, its light emerges in that same 
doorway after the fourth watch, then 
thirty mornings after the fourth watch by 
the Sun rising correctly within its width.
A Rest 
The period for a day is counted from 
Sunrise to Sunrise, but a Rest begins at 
twilight and ends at Sunrise. Henoch 
states that staying in bed the entire time 
is essential, doing nothing at all during 
the period from twilight until Sunrise.
Our Heavenly Father uses this Rest 
period to heal us and for a time for us to 
do as they all from Heaven do: rest from 
all activity. Read more detail in chapter 
83. No ceremony is described, and 
k n o w i n g H e n o c h w r o t e f o r a l l 
Humankind, all stations of people are 
encouraged to participate. The rest 
period ends at Sunrise, and no ceremony 
is described for the daytime activity after 
the rest period. Nevertheless, in our own 
experiences, we feel the afterglow of 
being in His presence on a Rest. Yes, 
during Rest, and always, He is never 
a w a y f r o m u s b e c a u s e o f H i s 
omnipresence; nevertheless, this time is 
for us to rest. Rest from all types of 
communication, and keep things to 
ourselves until the following day. Use this 
time to pray for healing, believing that the 
Lord-of-Spirits is our physician and 
better knows our needs than we can 
diagnose. Set a timer to remind you of 
preparation time to take care of hygiene 
needs for the Rest. Your children can 
participate in a family e ﬀort to Rest. Take 
time now to tell your pets with a simple, 
“Time to Rest.” our Heavenly Father is 
also with them at this time. Emergencies 
will happen; take care of what needs our 
attention, then go back to bed.
Start the Rest at twilight:  72:10 In the 
time extended beyond daytime, before 
night,  this  time  will  achieve  the  
separation  before  night,  being  the 
division.
End the Rest at Sunrise: 74:8 Moreover, 
it will remain a Rest until after the fourth 
watch, when the Sun’s light emerges.
These rules apply even to the Rest of 
longest duration (Rest 41). 72:15 
They 
who raise before the start of the day, 
should be stretched out for the night, 
283

=== Page 286 ===
until the Sun’s light appears east as the 
Sun has continued its march toward the 
next point to emerge,
 in that direction 
towards what remains [of the week], this 
happens at the sixth [night] of what will 
be thirty mornings.
Concerning twilight and Sunrise times 
for your area 
https://Sunrise-Sunset.org/  Use this link, 
enter your location, scroll to the chart 
and use the column labeled Twilight end 
for the time to start your Rest [not 
Nautical or Astronomical Twilight end], 
resting until the Sunrise shown on the 
ﬁrst page of this link. We set three alarms 
on our phone to remind us of preparation 
time, to begin the Rest [which we mute], 
and the end of the Rest, along with using 
airplane mode  and nulling text tones for 
no disrupting calls.
Total 364 days 
An example of using only thirty day 
months occurs throughout chapters 
72-82, the ﬁrst starts at Henoch 72:32 
On this day, the time for the night had 
already started to decrease to after the 
time for the ninth month. This time after 
the ninth month is from the ninth month, 
lasting until the time for day changes 
daily to become equal to the nighttime 
[March 16]. 
On this day, the year had 
terminated at three-hundred and sixty-
four days
.
Establishing the day of waiting [till the 
ﬁrst Rest], and ﬁrst day of the year 
The day after the 364th day of the year is 
this day of waiting. Named this, because 
the 364th day of the year happens to 
always be the sixth day after the 
subsequent [51st] Rest, and the next day 
being the seventh day we would normally 
Rest at twilight. Nevertheless, we wait to 
the next morning when before Sunrise 
when we see the star HIP 96468, aligning 
with the location of the Sun’s rising point 
which then becomes Day-one and Rest-
one for the year. To ﬁnd this star, using 
https://stellarium-web.org/ use Search to 
ﬁnd HIP 96468. It will then be marked on 
the screen. I changed the time to just 
before Sunrise, on the 17th of march,  
and put a pice of tape on my screen 
marking the location [doorway] of the 
Sun, then I changed the time until I saw 
the star HIP 96468 (Melkeya’el) also at 
that same location within that doorway.
First proof Day of waiting at day of equal 
night at the expected Rest but to wait for 
the Rest the next day when HIP 96468 
alignments with the Sun at the doorway.
23:4 At this time, even Ragu’el, one from 
those holy Angels in my company, 
answered me, saying, “This that is 
remote, is what you saw in your vision. 
Within this track [The Milky Way, Asafa’el] 
is the one [star] which dwells in a place 
to be visible marking the eve of the [ﬁrst] 
Rest as a burning ﬁre, this single one, 
from all the bright lights of Heaven
.”
25:3 Yet answering me, “When it is 
announced from this region which is 
observed for waiting [through that day] 
for this chief [ﬁrst] to come. They like it, 
in their high places to the Lord, are 
seated in this same such place [The 
Milky Way, Asafa’el] when they are in His 
presence dwelling in holiness and are 
important to the Lord to be in their 
splendor everlasting 
when it arises, and it 
284

=== Page 287 ===
[the Sun] will be coming aligned from 
underneath it, as seen from Earth.
”
74:9 These are seen in the places where 
they were planted because they a ﬀect 
the order of the months 
by where they 
are [to align] on the evening [early 
morning] before a Rest, where the Sun 
rises
. 
The day of waiting [till the ﬁrst Rest], is a 
day not counted, and is the day of equal 
night and day time, March 16. This ﬁfth 
day of the year is the Vernal Equinox, 
March 21, when the Sun crosses the 
celestial equator going north. Pope 
Gregory the 8th, of Gregorian calendar 
fame, established this day to begin the 
spring season. The length of daylight and 
night is not equal this day. The literal 
meaning of the term Vernal Equinox, 
means fresh or new like spring (not equal 
night and day), Uriel tells us this is not 
the ﬁrst day of the spring season. 72:6 
Like this—the Sun will rise for the ﬁrst-
most month  through  the dedicated  
doorway for the Sun to emerge for those 
four places; it rises after the Sun is just 
outside  [this  doorway],  and  [wait  
because] this day is not for the ﬁrst Rest 
at the Sun’s eastern doorway. 
A second proof that March 16th,  is the 
day to wait is that the sixteenth of March 
is the day of equal daytime to nighttime. 
This is diﬃcult to determine by hand, 
however, I used 
https://
www.timeanddate.com/Sun/israel/
jerusalem?month=6&year=
 to ﬁnd this 
information. When we add the total times 
on March 16,  for Night, Astronomical 
Twilight, nautical Twilight In Jerusalem or 
elsewhere, the day of equal daytime and 
nighttime happens to be March 16, with 
a daytime of approximately 721 minutes 
and nighttime of 719 minutes. March 20 
or 21 is considered the vernal equinox, 
which has 729 minutes of daytime and 
713 minutes of nighttime, obviously not 
the calendar's waiting date. These times 
of duration change depending on your 
location. Additionally, this [night] is not 
equal to the Sun's duration because of 
the assignments given to the stars on the 
ﬁfth day. Each star will remain accurate, 
within their time to complete their year at 
the time in which they were observed. 
(This happens ﬁve days after the 16th of 
March,  on the 21st) Uriel supports this 
second proof at 72:32 On this day, the 
time for the night had already started to 
decrease to after the time for the ninth 
month. This time after the ninth month is 
from the ninth month, lasting until the 
time 
for day changes daily to become 
equal to the nighttime [March 16]. On this 
day, the year had terminated at three-
hundred and sixty-four days. 33 Linger 
through this time at night [which should 
have been a Rest], unto the next night 
which shortens, on the following night 
when it is time to have a Rest. 34 
Because this is where you are to wait a 
day’s march [of the Sun] in its journey to 
this day from the presence of that night 
to this night now oﬀered.
Uriel also supports this second proof 
again at 72:26 Then, by this time for the 
night when they each make the other half 
of the day and this night happens when 
Month-twelve is ended and in this space 
of time, they [the night and day times] are 
equal. - This statement is very plain. 
Plainly expressed, do not use the ﬁfth 
day of the year, March 21, to start the 
285

=== Page 288 ===
calendar, because the 16th,  is the day 
after the ﬁnal day of the year of equal day 
and night.
Day at the head of each season 
The ﬁrst counted day [day-1] on the 
calendar is a day added (intercalated). 
There are four days added, one at the 
head of each quarter [seasonal change]. 
Each of these are a Rest.
See this from Henoch 75:1 These will 
guide, purposed to be chief over tens of 
thousands on account of how many were 
created, above and beyond these four. 
Used for augmenting, they do not 
separate from their divine service 
because of how a year is supposed to be 
reckoned. These four days are bound 
unto these stars and are to be 
considered in the reckoning of a year.
Four days added to the head of each 
season 
All in quantity, in the region of their 
passing through, those of Yahweh [the 
stars] working with the Sun, in Heaven 
t o w a rd s a d o o r w a y w h e re t h e y 
intermingle, and they go forth a third time 
[in the fall] in each other's company at 
their rising with a large number, 
according to the order desired for the 
stars. At four [days], which augments a 
division between them [each season], in 
the midst of each of the four divisions in 
a year, which are in the place they open, 
both in the same place they proceed 
these four days. See also 72:16  Then, 
when it [the Sun] fulﬁlls thirty mornings, 
the daytime hours decrease individually 
yet ﬁt precisely into what is expected for 
this day gifted and joined to each division 
as a Rest.
It is imperative to count these four days 
as a part of the year. See this at Henoch 
75:1-2, and at 82:4-5
Thirty-day Months 
Each numbered month consists of thirty 
days, and there are twelve months. That 
would be 360 days and the four 
intercalated days at the head of each 
season make a total of 364 days in the 
year.
82:15 “Being next to the beginning of the 
ﬁrst season, like the ﬁrst, Melkeya’el 
begins the year when it has authority. It 
will dominate those who are in Heaven, 
of those named to ﬁt within the width of 
a doorway along with the Sun’s light 
emerging on that day they are to have 
dominion. Emerging where they will 
occupy this doorway, and on account of 
this, this makes each season ninety-one 
days.”
Spring 1+30+30+30 = 91
Summer 1+30+30+30 = 91
Fall 1+30+30+30 = 91
Winter 1+30+30+30 = 91
Total = 364

How to use this calendar 
1) This example is the 51st’s Twilight Rest marked with color, intending to depict 
starting a Rest at twilight.
2) Day 350 is also seen as the sixth day of the week after the Rest 50. These are 
the days of the week. See Henoch 60:1 Continuing through these things 
occurring in my lifetime up to my, ﬁve hundredth year then the seventh month of 
the year, and the fourth day after resting…

3) Then, day 351 is colored to show the twilight Rest 51, as the seventh day of the 
week.
4) These days are also known as Month-12, Day 16 of this month, and Month-12, 
day 17 of this month.

Waiting for the Rest 
1) Day 364 is the last day of the year, and because the next day is the seventh day 
after a Rest, we expect a Rest the next evening.
2) Nevertheless, we do not rest at the twilight of the uncounted day [16th],  and we 
wait through to the next twilight [17th], which starts the new year at the head of 
Spring, when we are to have our ﬁrst Rest of the year.
3) In the early morning of March 17th an observer would sit in a place with 
something to mark the star Melkeya’el’s position on the horizon, enabling the 
observer to compare the star’s position, to the position of the rising Sun on the 
17th. Today we use the software Stellarium to show this happening to us. The 
alignment of Melkeya’el and the Sun is what starts the ﬁrst day of the year.
4) This day of waiting, not counted, is also the day of equal daytime and nighttime.

Order of stars for each month
See the web site https://stellarium-web.org/ when using this chart. Use search, and the 
modern star names, ﬁnding where these stars and the Sunrise are at the horizon by 
sliding the time bar to emulate the Sunrise location and the star-rise location at the 
horizon. These Sun rising locations should align to the star’s rising location. These 
constellations in Asafa’el Milky Way [Hen 82:20] have nothing in connection to the 
occult crafts or a Zodiac for astrology.
74:5 The change to each month is accomplished according to the Sun, on account of 
these [stars that remained] centering a doorway, [observed] from the third and fourth 
watches [of the morning].

Two proofs are required to start the Calendar for Rest 
First proof: Locate the day where the duration of night equals that of the day time. 
See Hen 72:26 Then, by this time for the night when they each make the other half of 
the day and this night happens when Month-twelve is ended and in this space of time, 
they [the night and day times] are equal. 
Hen 72:32 On this day, the time for the night had already started to decrease to after 
the time for the ninth month. This time after the ninth month is from the ninth 
month, lasting until the time for day changes daily to become equal to the nighttime 
[March 16]. On this day, the year had terminated at three-hundred and sixty-four 
days.

Additional information for understanding how a calendar works 
and issues when combining two different types of calendars.  
 The first issue is using a Leap day within a leap year. Uriel sta ted many times to 
use only 364 days for a year. This being true, we will begin the calendar year on a 
Gregorian March 17th, no matter if we have experienced a leap year with 366 days. On 
a leap year, we will need to wait for two days in the end because of the occurrence of a 
Gregorian leap day.  
Hen 75:2 Then for the sake of those of Humankind who will be deceived concerning 
these high places that are illuminated; these remain accurate in servitude to this high 
position forever, from being the first present in the doorway. Then thirtyfold doorways 
from the fourth division [winter] to like a sixth doorway next to that doorway exactly 
where it is expected for Humankind to announce the three-hundred and sixty-fourth 
day then bringing it [the year] to a conclusion for Humankind.

The first Rest, regardless of a Gregorian leap year, will always be on March 17, 
because this is the day the star and the Sun align. 
Notice in this chart how the Vernal equinox alters from year to year. This is 
why the vernal equinox is not appropriate to start the calendar. 
Compare the days for a Gregorian year, and the days that Urial proclaimed to 
use for a calendar year. The days that Urial proclaimed is always 364. From 
this we see that the Calendar from Urial is always constant.
